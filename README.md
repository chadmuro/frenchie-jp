# Tokyo Frenchies :dog:
I wanted to help my French Bulldog puppy make friends. Tokyo Frenchies is a meetup event website for French Bulldogs and their owners in Tokyo. I used React Router to hook up routing to the application and MailChimp's API to create a mailing list. There is an events page, photo gallery, and discussion board where members can connect.
